# Tasks: Context-Aware Command Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/alexandr/Repository/local-doc-bro/specs/019-spicing-commands-up/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: Python 3.13+, Click, Rich, Pydantic v2, FastAPI, pytest
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: 5 entities → 5 model tasks
   → contracts/: CLI + MCP contracts → 12 contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 4 user scenarios → 4 integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, database migration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD approach)
   → Core: models, services, CLI enhancements, wizards
   → Integration: MCP endpoints, flag standardization
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph and parallel execution examples
```

## Dependencies

### Setup Dependencies
- T001-T004 must complete before any other tasks

### TDD Dependencies (Critical Path)
- **All tests (T005-T022) MUST complete and FAIL before implementation (T023-T053)**
- Models (T023-T027) before services (T028-T031, T041-T042)
- Context services (T028-T031) before CLI enhancements (T037-T040)
- Wizard framework (T032-T036) before CLI wizard integration (T037-T040)

- **Memory Efficiency**: Wizard sessions must use <50MB memory per active session
- **Database Compatibility**: All features must work identically with SQLite-vec and Qdrant
- **Constitutional Performance**: Complete setup <30s, system validation <5s (T065, T066)

### Validation Checklist
*GATE: Must pass before marking feature complete*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T018 ✓)
- [ ] All entities have model tasks (T023-T027 ✓)
- [ ] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3 ✓)
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent (file-level separation ✓)
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path (all tasks ✓)
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (verified ✓)

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - can run simultaneously
- **Critical TDD Rule**: Verify ALL tests fail before implementing any functionality
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each completed task to maintain atomic changes
- **Error Handling**: Each component must handle failures gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **Performance Monitoring**: Include timing and memory metrics in all services
