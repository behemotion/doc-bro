# Feature Specification: DocBro - Documentation Web Crawler

**Feature Branch**: `001-local-doc-bro`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "local doc bro we - web crawler with fully local capabilities which takes a url and crawls documentation with variable depth. it creates vector database in qdrant db out of his crawl results. it allows to store multiple crawl projects. it has cli interface with commands, flags and methods to operate its functions. it shows it all using --help command. it stores retrieved documentations in projects which can be renamed by user. it keeps the initial page url in the projects properties. it has an MCP server to connect to it using mcp client. it uses locally installed ollama with mxbai-embed-large model to make its embaddings (with support for other models). it uses advanced rag strategies to perform RAG. it allows to redo crawling projects by user. it suggests to make it after adjustable fixed time interval (base - two months) via marking projects with red color and outdated flag when user uses list command. it allows coding agents such as claude code to connect to it via mcp and has several commands for them to retrieve valuable pieces of documentation in customizable chunks. it should be able to crawl and vectorize solid amounts of data (more then 1 gb per project). it should allow to change embedding model. it should be distributable using uv or uvx package"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: For the outdated project detection feature, what should be the default time interval after which projects are marked as outdated? → A: 60 days (2 months)
- Q: Which essential CLI commands should the system provide for managing documentation projects? → A: Full set: crawl, list, query, rename, delete, recrawl, export, import, config, status
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent crawling operations? → A: Single crawl only - queue others
- Q: What RAG strategies should the system prioritize for documentation retrieval? → A: Semantic search + reranking + context expansion + query decomposition
- Q: How should the system handle network failures during crawling operations? → A: Retry 5 times with backoff, then skip and continue
- User clarification: Tool should be called "docbro" in the terminal when user works with it

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or coding agent, I want to crawl documentation websites and create searchable knowledge bases so that I can quickly retrieve relevant documentation snippets for my coding tasks without needing to search online repeatedly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid documentation URL, **When** user initiates a crawl with specified depth, **Then** system crawls all pages within that depth and creates a searchable project
2. **Given** an existing documentation project, **When** user queries for specific topics, **Then** system returns relevant documentation chunks ranked by relevance
3. **Given** multiple crawled projects, **When** user lists all projects, **Then** system displays all projects with their names, source URLs, and outdated status indicators
4. **Given** a project older than the configured time interval, **When** user lists projects, **Then** system marks the project as outdated with visual indicators
5. **Given** a coding agent connected via protocol, **When** agent requests documentation, **Then** system provides documentation in appropriately sized chunks
6. **Given** an existing project, **When** user renames it, **Then** system updates the project name while preserving all crawled data
7. **Given** an outdated project, **When** user initiates re-crawl, **Then** system updates the project with fresh documentation from the same source

### Edge Cases
- What happens when crawling encounters rate limiting or blocked pages?
- How does system handle extremely large documentation sites (>1GB)?
- What occurs when the original URL structure has changed during re-crawling?
- How does system behave when network connection is lost mid-crawl?
- What happens when duplicate content is encountered across pages?
- How does system handle JavaScript-rendered documentation pages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate web crawling from a provided URL with configurable depth levels
- **FR-002**: System MUST store crawled documentation in named projects that can be managed independently
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide command-line interface accessible as "docbro" with help documentation accessible via standard help flags
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to rename existing documentation projects
- **FR-005**: System MUST store and display the original source URL for each project
- **FR-006**: System MUST support re-crawling of existing projects to update their content
- **FR-007**: System MUST track project age and mark projects as outdated after 60 days by default (configurable)
- **FR-008**: System MUST visually indicate outdated projects in project listings with color coding and status flags
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide server capabilities for external agent connections
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow external agents to query and retrieve documentation in customizable chunk sizes
- **FR-011**: System MUST support processing and storing large documentation sets exceeding 1GB per project
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to change the embedding model used for vectorization
- **FR-013**: System MUST be packagable for distribution and installation by end users
- **FR-014**: System MUST perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer queries about stored documentation
- **FR-015**: System MUST create vector embeddings of all crawled content for semantic search capabilities
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide CLI commands: crawl (initiate crawling), list (show projects), query (search documentation), rename (change project name), delete (remove project), recrawl (update existing project), export (extract project data), import (load project data), config (manage settings), status (show system state)
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle network failures with 5 retries using exponential backoff, skip failed pages and continue crawling, validate URLs before crawling, and report authentication-required pages as skipped
- **FR-018**: System MUST support advanced RAG strategies including semantic search, result reranking, context expansion, and query decomposition
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow only single crawl operation at a time, queuing additional crawl requests
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow manual deletion of projects with no automatic cleanup (projects persist until explicitly deleted)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Project**: Represents a crawled documentation source with its vector database, containing source URL, creation date, last update date, project name, and outdated status
- **Crawled Page**: Individual documentation page with its content, URL, crawl depth, embeddings, and metadata
- **Query Result**: Documentation chunk returned from searches, including relevance score, source page reference, and content snippet
- **Crawl Configuration**: Settings for a crawl operation including depth limit, URL patterns to include/exclude, and crawl rate limits
- **Agent Session**: Connection from an external coding agent with its query history and chunk size preferences
