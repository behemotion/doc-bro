# DocBro Comprehensive Test Remediation Plan

**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: 848 passing, 980 failing, 181 skipped
**Goal**: Achieve >95% test pass rate (2100+ of 2237 tests passing)

---

## Reference Documents (ALWAYS CHECK BEFORE STARTING EACH TASK)

- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Core architectural principles, service-oriented architecture, TDD requirements
- **Dependencies**: `.specify/memory/dependencies.md` - All package versions with justifications
- **Test Fixes**: `TASKS_TEST_FIXES.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- **Feature Specs**: `FEATURES_PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete feature specifications
- **Development Guide**: `CLAUDE.md` - Current architecture and patterns

---

## Agent Instructions

**FOR EVERY TASK:**
1. Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` FIRST to understand architectural principles
2. Read `.specify/memory/dependencies.md` SECOND to verify package versions
3. Read task description from this plan
4. Check relevant test files to understand expectations
5. Implement following TDD: tests exist → write minimal code → pass tests → refactor
6. Update this plan: mark task complete with ✅ and add completion notes
7. Commit changes with descriptive message referencing task number

**COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN:**
- UV tool install uses committed state, NOT working directory
- Commit before testing ANY installation
- Commit after completing each task or logical group

**VALIDATION AFTER EACH PHASE:**
```bash
# Run tests for completed phase
pytest tests/ -k "relevant_pattern" -v

# Check overall progress
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short | tail -20
```

---

### T001: Delete Legacy Project Tests ✅ COMPLETE
- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_cli_batch_crawl.py` - Uses removed BatchCrawler
- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_cli_crawl_update.py` - Uses removed ProjectManager

- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_project_create_cli.py` - Old project concept
- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_project_list_cli.py` - Old project concept
- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_project_remove_cli.py` - Old project concept
- [X] **Delete** `tests/contract/test_upload_files_cli.py` - Uses removed UploadManager
